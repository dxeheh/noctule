# noctule
Noctule is a penetration testing tool designed to scan a target url for a selected vulnerability from a list of common vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion, and Remote Code Execution (in development).
## Getting Started
Noctule is not particurally difficult to install, but here's some basic information about the setup process.
### Prerequisites
This is a list of things you need to get before you can use Noctule. I'll update it when (if) there's any more, but there won't be.
```
Python 3.x
```
### Installing
Installing is as easy as clicking the green button that says `Clone or download` and then `Open in Desktop` or `Download Zip`.  
If you want you can use git to clone it using this command, but if you're reading this you probably don't have it installed.
```
git clone https://githib.com/dxeheh/noctule
```
